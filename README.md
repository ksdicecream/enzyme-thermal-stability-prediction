# Enzyme Thermal Stability Prediction

We wanted to find out if we could accurately predict the thermal stability of an enzyme.
Enzyme stability is important for determining if the application of biocatalysis is successful. Enzymes are very important as they facilitate biochemical reactions throughout our bodies.
Using Machine Learning models such as KNearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, RandomForest Regressor, and Deep Neural Networks, we predicted the thermal stability of an enzyme based on the pH and the protein sequence.
We determined the accuracy of the model by using the Root Mean Squared Error value. We concluded that the RandomForest Regressor had the best accuracy and could accurately predict the thermal stability of an enzyme. Our hypothesis had been proven correct.
