When submitting a protein (amino acid) sequence, you can append copies of commonly used epitopes and fusion proteins using the supplied list.\n","- Gravy\n","    - The GRAVY number of a protein is a measure of its hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. The two measures are combined in a hydropathy scale or hydropathy index. Hydropathy here means \"hydro\", water, + \"pathy\", activity.\n","- Amino Acid Count\n","    - The sequence of a protein is usually notated as a string of letters, according to the order of the amino acids from the amino-terminal to the carboxyl-terminal of the protein. Either a single or three-letter code may be used to represent each amino acid in the sequence.\n","- Secondary structure fraction\n","    - The structure refers to the shape in which a long polypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in two different types of structures α – helix and β – pleated sheet structures.\n","- Aromaticity\n","    - Aromaticity is a chemical property associated with such cyclic and planar compounds and is attributed to these π-electrons which are free to cycle around the circular arrangements of atoms found in the aromatic moieties.\n","- Isoelectric point\n","    - The isoelectric point, or pI,represents a point of balance for a molecule, where the external surface charge is a net zero. This factor governs electrophoretic mobility in proteins and also plays a role in identifying peptides from mass spectral proteomics
